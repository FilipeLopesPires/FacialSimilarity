# TAI - Projects 1,2 and 3

These projects were developed under the discipline of Algorithmic Information Theory.

Project 1 is about information models for prediction and the development of a text generator.
Project 2 is about vector quantization and the use of clustering for music identification.
Project 3 is about a compression-based face identifier through image similarity.

Most of the programs have instructions on how to run examples and all of the code is documented.
Each project contains a report that states the work done, the characteristics of the solutions and the discussion of the results.
