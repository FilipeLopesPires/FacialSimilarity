The files "ctx1" and "ctx2" contain examples of 2D context templates. These
files contain an integer with the size of the context, followed by that number
of relative coordinate pairs, in the form of "row col". The "0 0" coordinate
corresponds to the pixel being compressed. These coordinates are followed by
a "n/d" entry representing the "alpha" of the probability estimator, in the
form numerator/denominator. Hence, "1/10" denotes an alpha of 0.1

From within the "examples" dir, try to run:

../bin/ImgCondComp -rc ctx1 -r 01.pgm -t 06.pgm

This will give the number of bits needed to represent image "06.pgm" (i.e.,
the target), when image "01.pgm" is given as reference and the context
used by the references is described in file "ctx1".

The command

../bin/ImgCondComp -rc ctx1 -tc ctx2 -r 01.pgm -t 06.pgm

will give the number of bits needed to represent image "06.pgm" when image
"01.pgm" is given as reference, the context used by the reference model is
in file "ctx1" and the context used by the target model is in file "ctx2".

The command

../bin/ImgCondComp -tc ctx1 -t 06.pgm

will give the number of bits needed to represent image "06.pgm" using the
the context described in file "ctx1".

The command

TEST123

will run a classification example on the 40 subjects, using the first three
images of each subject as reference and testing on the remaining seven images.
It measures similarity using the NCCD (Normalized Conditional Compression Distance).
