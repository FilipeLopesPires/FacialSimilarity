# Directory description

 - **orl_faces:** original dataset ("The Database of Faces")

 - **processedFaces:** dataset after preprocessing (size reduction and quantization)

 - **report:** written report explaining the work developed, presenting study results and conclusions

 - **experiments:** face identification studies conducted and performance evaluation scripts

 - **src:** source code (Shell scripts)

 - **src_nccd:** source code of NCCD given for the assignment

 - **bin:** binary files of the source code of NCCD given for the assignment

 - **examples:** example files and code for the content given for the assignment

# Main programs description

 - **src/checkCompressors:** developed to help us manually verifying each compressor.
 For each candidate, we compressed an example image and the concatenation of itself, and then ran this script.
 What it does is collect the outcomes of the compressions and print them to the console side by side for us to quickly detect which break the C(x,x) â‰ˆ C(x) condition.

 - **src/preprocessImages:** script to apply transformations to the images present on the original dataset to later be processed
 by the other scripts.

 - **src/testCompressors:** using the NCD formula, tests several compressors to classify different subjects of the
 faces dataset

 - **experiments/calculateAccuracy:** calculates the accuracy of each compressor accordingly to the output of the
 src/testCompressors script

 - **experiments/nccdAccuracy:** calculates the accuracy using a conditional compressor accordingly to the output
 of the src/TEST123 script

# How to run and build

Some examples are :

- **./src/preprocessing** while on the path of this README file, applies the some preprocessing transformations
to the faces dataset present on the directory orl_faces/, outputting the result to the directory processedFaces/

- **./src/checkCompressors.sh processedFaces/s01/01.pgm** outputs the sizes of the compressed files generated by
each compressor for the different merger methods and compressing the image alone, using the 
processedFaces/s01/01.pgm as target file to compress

- **./src/testCompressor.sh append** tests the different compressors following the NCD formula to classify
faces of the dataset using the append merge method
  
Some scripts have mandatory arguments. To have information about them call them without parameters, like:

`$ ./build/<script_name>`
